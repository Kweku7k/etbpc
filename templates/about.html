                <br/>


<p>
    The Endtime Bible Project For Christ(EBPFC) is a non- denominational Christian organization with voluntary partnership/membership. It is registered under the companies Act,2019 [ Act 992]
    About 7 years ago, the Visioneers of EBPFC who were involved in campus ministry increasingly became burdened to start purchasing Bibles in small quantities for distribution to students who didn’t have and encouraged them to read it, love it and live it. As time went on the burden moved on to looking for opportunities to distribute not only to students but new converts outside campuses who didn’t own Bibles. This went on till the year 2021 when the Visioneers thought that the vision should be formalised. And on the 17th November 2021 it was incorporated under the companies Act with the name EndTime Bible Project For Christ.
    In 2021 alone 526 Bibles were purchased from the Bible Society of Ghana and distributed. In 2022, Endtime Bible Project For Christ seeks to purchase and distribute not less than 1,000 copies of Bibles for distribution to the inmates of Prisons, converts in local churches  communities and schools, and braille bibles for the schools for the blind. Already this year, we have donated 160 copies of Bibles to the James Camp Prisons in Accra, apart from what has been given to our local church.

<h6 style="color: blue;" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in" data-aos-duration="500"><b>OUR MISSION</b></h6>

<p>
    The Endtime Bible Project For Christ seeks to put the Bible freely in the hands of every new convert, especially the under privileged. It also seeks to making sure the threat of the hard copy Bible going extinct is reversed and prevented in these modern times that people are getting addicted to Bible apps on their gadgets
</p>




<h6 style="color: blue;" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in" data-aos-duration="500"><b>OUR VISION</b></h6>
<p>

    Our vision is to distribute Bibles to prison inmates, students including those in the vision impaired schools,  converts in our churches and our communities through evangelism.
</p>

<h6 style="color: blue;" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in" data-aos-duration="500"><b>MODUS OPERANDI</b></h6>

 
<p>

    The Endtime Bible Project For Christ exists to ensure that our mission of not making the Bible extinct and making the bible available to every Christian are achieved. This is what God has tasked us to do. 
    We raise funds from people who share what the Holy Spirit has commissioned us to do, and we use the money to buy Bibles mainly from Ghana Bible Society.
    We don't do this because we want God to bless us. We do this because it is the Fathers business, we do this because we love Jesus Christ our Lord and Master and we also do this because we are in the Endtime and many need to come to Jesus Christ through His Word.
</p>
